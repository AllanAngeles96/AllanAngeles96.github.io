					<p>
						I was born on June 28th, 1996 and I have always lived in Everett, WA. My family has lived in many places though, such as; California, Florida, and even places outside of the US like the Philippines and Korea!
					</p> 
					<p>
						I currently work as a Barista at Starbucks and also at my family's donut shop in Seattle. I want to become better in web development because making something, like a website, from the ground up has always sounded cool to me. Even before I graduated highschool I wanted to program but never sought out a way to actually do it. But alas, here I am!
					</p>
					<p>
						My hobbies are playing music, primarily, as well as playing games, hanging out with friends, hiking (occasionally), and sleeping. I started playing music when I was 13 when my sister bought me my first guitar for my birthday. So I decided to learn to play music because it was something that nobody in my family knew how to do yet and I wanted to be the first.
